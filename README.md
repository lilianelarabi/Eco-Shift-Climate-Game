**Eco-Shift** is an educational game built with the **Unity Engine** and **C#**, designed to translate complex climate science into an interactive experience.  
Rather than presenting facts in static charts, Eco-Shift places players in a **side-scrolling, story-driven world** where every decision nudges Earth’s future in a better — or worse — direction.

## 🎮 Why Eco-Shift?
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, yet communicating its urgency to younger audiences often falls short. Reports are overwhelming, and statistics feel abstract.  

Eco-Shift tackles this gap by combining:
- **Scientific accuracy** → Real datasets from the [U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions).  
- **Accessible design** → A pixel-art side scroller that feels familiar but carries weight.  
- **Decision-based storytelling** → Players see the *immediate consequences* of their actions, not just numbers on a graph.  

Guided by atmospheric scientist **Dr. Róisín Commane**, players travel through pivotal moments in climate history, learning how individual and collective choices ripple across generations.

## 🧩 Core Mechanics
- **Interactive Choice System** → Every decision affects both visuals and outcomes.  
- **Temporal Progression** → Move from the pre-industrial era to modern climate challenges.  
- **Dynamic Feedback** → Positive actions reinforce sustainability, while harmful ones produce visible degradation.  
- **Real Data Integration** → Game logic ties directly to greenhouse gas datasets for authenticity.  

---
## 👥 Who It’s For
- **Students (7–18)** → Players who spend time on games and social media but often lack structured climate knowledge.  
- **Educators & NGOs** → Institutions seeking accessible, gamified tools for climate literacy.  
- **Curious Learners** → Anyone interested in exploring climate decisions through play, not just text.
